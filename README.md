#CSS-Flag-Project

This project is a simple HTML/CSS representation of a flag design. It showcases the design of a flag using basic HTML structure and CSS styling.

Flag Design:
The flag design consists of a red background with a white horizontal stripe in the middle and a black emblem at the top. The emblem features an eagle image.

HTML Structure:
The HTML file includes a <div> element with the class "flag," representing the flag container. Inside this container, there's another <div> element containing the white stripe and the black emblem.

CSS Styling:
The CSS file contains styling rules for the flag design.
The .flag class sets the dimensions and background color of the flag container.
Inside the flag container, the .eagle class positions the eagle image within the emblem area.
Other styling rules define the dimensions, colors, and positions of the various elements within the flag design.
To consolidate what I was learning online I did this project. Only using CSS and HTML created a Flag of Egypt.
This tested different CSS components.

History Of The Flag Of Egypt
The Egyptian flag has experienced a number of changes before arriving in its current form. It originally featured a single hue, red, a crescent-shaped design, and three stars under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. The layout was utilized up until 1882 when the British started to occupy the area following the Urabi Revolt. To represent the nation's small Christian minority, the cross was added to the crescent and the three stars. The decision, however, was incredibly unpopular and increased nationalist discontent toward the British invaders, which ultimately sparked the 1919 Revolution.

King Fuad removed the cross from the flag and altered its color to green after the country gained independence from the British in 1922. The three stars, which represented the Kingdom and were also represented by the green color, represented the agricultural activity taking place in Sudan and Nubia as well as in Egypt along the Nile.

King Fuad I was removed from power by the Egyptian free officers following the 1952 Revolution. The flag's original green backdrop was swapped out for a tricolor of red, white, and black with Saladin's eagle in the center. After Egypt and Syria joined forces to create the United Arab Republic in 1958, two green stars finally took the place of the eagle. After overthrowing King Farouk, who had the help of the British, Abdel Nasser assumed power in 1958. After Libya and Egypt joined forces to form a new Federation of Arab Republics in 1961, Syria eventually withdrew from the United Arab Republic, and the Hawk of Quraish took the place of the two stars.

In 1977, the Federation of Arab Republics was dissolved, and in 1982, the Eagle of Saladin was restored to the Egyptian flag; and the red band was made darker to make it different from similar flags of Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Gold was used on the eagle together with white. It has been in use since 1982.
