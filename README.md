To consolidate what I was learning online I did this project. Only using CSS and HTML created a Flag of Egypt.
This tested different CSS components.

History Of The Flag Of Egypt
The Egyptian flag has undergone several transformations before its present state. At first, under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, it consisted of a single color, red, a crescent shape, and three stars. The design was used until the British began their occupation after the Urabi Revolt in 1882. The cross was added to the crescent and three stars to represent the Christian minority in the country. However, the move was deeply unpopular, and it raised greater nationalist resentment against the British occupiers, subsequently leading to the 1919 Revolution.

Upon independence from the British in 1922, King Fuad I changed the flag color to green and excluded the cross. The green color represented the agricultural activities taking place in Egypt along the Nile as well as in Sudan and Nubia, which were also part of the Kingdom and were represented by the three stars.

The 1952 Revolution led to the deposing of King Fuad I by the Egyptian free officers. The green background of the flag was replaced with a tricolor of red, white, and black with the eagle of Saladin in the middle. Two green stars eventually replaced the eagle when Egypt and Syria united to form the United Arab Republic in 1958. Abdel Nasser took over in 1958 after toppling King Farouk who had the support of the British. In 1961, Syria eventually withdrew from the United Arab Republic, and the Hawk of Quraish replaced the two stars after Libya joined Egypt in a new Federation of Arab Republics.

In 1977, the Federation of Arab Republics was dissolved, and in 1982, the Eagle of Saladin was restored to the Egyptian flag; and the red band was made darker to make it different from similar flags of Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Gold was used on the eagle together with white. It has been in use since 1982.
